DAY 20: LOCALSTORAGE AND SESSIONSTORAGE

Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage
Task 1: Write a script to save a string value to localstorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
Task 2: Write a script to save an object to localstorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

Activity 2: Using LocalStorage
Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to localStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
Task 4: Write a script to remove an item from localStorage. Log the localStorage content before and after removal.

Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage
Task 5: Write a script to save a string value to sessionStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
Task 6: Write a script to save an object to sessionStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

Activity 4: Using SessionStorage
Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to sessionStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
Task 8: Write a script to remove an item from sessionStorage. Log the sessionStorage content before and after removal.

Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Task 9: Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both localstorage and sessionStorage. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
Task 10: Write a function that clears all data from both localStorage and sessionStorage. Verify that both storages are empty.
